        <h1>Sorry for the wait...</h1>
        <h3>By: Noel Nimstad</h3>
        <p>First of all, i need to explain what this is, <i>and what it isn't</i>.
        <br/>This newsletter is a place where i can ramble a bit about development while sharing progress made.
        Originally this newsletter was planned to be weekly, <i>however</i> i am now unsure if i want any schedule at all, at the very least weekly. 
        The most likely option is that i either make this newsletter a forthnightly publishing, or a publishing without a schedule.
        If you join <a href="https://discord.gg/Pga3bnY2" target="_blank">the discord</a> then i will ping @everyone once i release a newsletter <i>(unless i figure out a schedule that fits me)</i>.
        <br/><br/>That's probably enough about the schedule, now let's talk about what this game is, because it's not the same story anymore
        <hr/>
        <h2>Game without a name (sort of)</h2>
        <img src="img/C1_TheRoom.png" class="banner"/>
        <p class="img-note">Both the bookshelf and bed are going to be changed</p>
        <p>The game currently does not have a confirmed name, Sedimentary, the original game name, does not match the direction of the current story line, because the game does not take place in a cave (at least not a majority of it).
        <b>My current placeholder name is "Today, But Soon Tomorrow"</b>, <i>side note, but bold text marks points of intrest, if you just want to skim through each newsletter; then look at the images and text in bold</i>.
        If you, <i>after knowing what the story is about</i>, have any name suggestions then please feel free to send them my way in the discord.
        <br/><br/><b>Currently, the plan is to release the game chapter wise</b>, with each chapter spanning somewhere between 1-3 nights depending on how indepth i want each night to be, now what are these nights?
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>The story (spoiler warning i guess)</h2>
        <img src="img/spoilers.png" class="banner"/>
        <p class="img-note">if you want to play the game blind, skip this part</p>
        <p>Spoiler warning out of the way, the main story is about the player waking up each night, with time "frozen". In adition to just waking up, each night progressivley weirder things happen; at first the player may find their clock broken, or items that weren't originally in their room, though as the nights pass, they may wake up to their door being open and finding a whole new world outside their room...</p>

        <h2>Progress</h2>
        <p><b>Since i started a new unity project when i redid the story, the only thing implemented so far is basic player movement</b>.
        However this doesn't mean that everything made in the old game has gone to vain, i will be using code written there and refrencing it in the future; along side that writing everything i did then helped me learn more about how to unity.
        <br/><br/>Next time i publish a news letter, at the very least i will have implemented interacting with objects in the world, after that i will be working on a dialogue system (again)</p>
