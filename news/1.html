        <h1>Saving & Dialogue</h1>

        <h2>Dialogue!</h2>
        <p>Dialogue plays an important role in an RPG so having a reliable system is extremly important.
        Last time I built a dialogue system for the previous game it didn't go to plan, I ended up fighting it every time I wanted to add some dialogue to the game.
        This time however I built a really flexible and optimised dialogue system that is easy to rework and won't need as much maintanence as the old one did.

        <h2>I made a font</h2>
        <p>For the dialogue I wanted a hand made, pixel perfect font so I threw together <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eVWGZ8rje12OJAyzh-SG8fDpLErk1Ftm/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Bitstad</a>.

        <h2>Saving</h2>
        <p>Saving is yet another feature I felt was, minorly important to a RPG game, so I decided it was worth the trouble of throwing together.

            The game stores your game inside a C# class, and when the player saves their data the game will convert that class into JSON, and then binary and then write it to a file stored away somewhere where the player won't find it and accidentaly mess it up.
