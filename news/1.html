        <h1>Saving & Dialogue</h1>

        <h2>Dialogue!</h2>
        <p>Dialogue plays an important role in an RPG so having a reliable system is extremly important.
        Last time I built a dialogue system for the previous game it didn't go to plan, I ended up fighting it every time I wanted to add some dialogue to the game.
        This time however I built a really flexible and optimised dialogue system that is easy to rework and won't need as much maintanence as the old one did.

        <h2>Saving</h2>
        <p>Saving is yet another feature I felt was, minorly important to a RPG game, so I decided it was worth the trouble of throwing together.
