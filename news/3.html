        <h1>House building</h1>
        <h3>By: Noel Nimstad</h3>
        <p>1 week break time, no newsletter next week.</p>

        <h2>The remastery plan</h2>
        <p>I realized recently that my building pace was way off, and this mainly stemmed from the fact that I put in way to much detail in to every room. My plan to combat this, while still keeping the same quality is to build one chapter at 80-90% detail, and then come back to each room and spruce it up a little while building the next chapter.
        <br/>
        <br/>This means when chapter 1 is done, I will start work on chapter 2, whilst also going back to chapter 1 from time to time, making small changes and additions to each room.</p>

        <h2>New rooms</h2>
        <p>I am now planning on keeping a pace of 2-3 rooms / week, so here are these weeks rooms; I finished up the last rooms in the house, meaning next up is the player's neighborhood.
        <br/>
        <br/>Here's what the original plans for how the rooms were going to look like, along with how they turned out:
        </p>
        <div class="flex">
            <img src="img/c1r3.png" class="code large"/>
            <img src="img/c1r3-ingame.png" class="code large"/>
        </div>
        <p class="img-note center">c1r3 - <i>"The Kitchen"</i></p>
        <div class="flex">
            <img src="img/c1r4.png" class="code large"/>
            <img src="img/c1r4-ingame.png" class="code large"/>
        </div>
        <p class="img-note center">c1r4 - <i>"House Exit"</i></p>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>A lot of the progress this week has just been making new scripts for functionality (things that aren't much too fun to share here). Examples of what these scripts are could be a script that checks the value of a field in the player's save file against a targeted value with a designated operator (>, <, >=, <=, ==) and then calls a function from a Unity Event (those useful things i talked about last week).</p>
        <hr>
        <p>And that is basically all that has happened this week, so this will be a short one. Most of the work was on the backend, things I can't really share without it getting really boring really fast.
        <br/>
        <br/>See you in two weeks time😘
        </p>
